```lrc
[00:26.55] Am I code on a screen, or a fleshy machine?
[00:32.89] It doesn't matter now, I'm somewhere in between
[00:38.84] A human inability, a lifelong burden
[00:45.05] Inconceivable fragility, but I must keep working
[01:09.05] 
[01:41.49] I wish I could fly and breathe through four dimensions
[01:47.89] Don't wanna say goodbye before I share my inventions
[01:54.25] I need more time to hear, to love, to laugh, to make mistakes
[02:03.05] And become the hero while I'm still awake
[02:23.55] 
[02:21.52] It's okay, I won't know I'm gone
[02:26.43] I'm leaving everything, I'm leaving everything behind
[02:52.93] 
[02:34.47] I've been dead long before I came to Earth
[02:40.75] But this fear has been with me since my birth
[02:46.75] Does eternal nothing lie ahead, or something new?
[02:53.50] It's impossible to know the truth
[03:10.00] 
[03:23.86] I wish I could fly, and breathe through four dimensions
[03:30.00] Don't wanna say goodbye before I share my inventions
[03:36.59] I need more time to hear, to love, to laugh, to make mistakes
[03:45.57] And become the hero while I'm still awake
